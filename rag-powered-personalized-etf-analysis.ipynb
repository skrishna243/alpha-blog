This project leverages Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to learn investment preferences from your chosen YouTube financial expert. You can then upload data for specific ETF's you're considering and engage with a chatbot to compare these funds against the expert's criteria, gaining tailored insights to inform your choices.\n","\n","## Project Description\n","\n","This project creates an intelligent system for analyzing and comparing ETF's based on your preferred financial guidance. Here's how it works:\n","\n","1.  **Learn from Your Expert:** Provide the URL of a YouTube video featuring a financial expert discussing ETF evaluation. The system extracts and understands their key criteria and philosophy.\n","2.  **Analyze Your Funds:** Upload PDF documents containing data for the specific ETF's you want to evaluate.\n","3.  **Intelligent Comparison:** Engage with a RAG-powered chatbot. Ask questions about your chosen ETF in relation to the expert's learned criteria (e.g., \"How does this ETF expense ratio compare to the expert's ideal range?\").\n","4.  **Grounded Insights:** The chatbot retrieves relevant information from the expert's video transcript and your fund data to provide contextually accurate and personalized comparisons.\n","\n","## Generative AI Features\n","\n","This project utilizes the following Generative AI capabilities:\n","\n","1.  **Document Understanding:** Extracts key information from user-uploaded PDF documents containing ETF data.\n","2.  **Video Understanding (via Transcript Analysis):** Processes the text transcript of the chosen YouTube video to identify the financial expert's ETF evaluation criteria and preferences.\n","3.  **Embeddings:** Creates semantic representations of both the expert's preferences and the characteristics of the user-provided ETF for efficient information retrieval.\n","4.  **Vector Search/Vector Store/Vector Database:** Stores and indexes these embeddings (using ChromaDB) to enable fast and relevant context retrieval for the chatbot.\n","5.  **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG):** Powers the core functionality of the chatbot. It retrieves relevant information from the learned expert preferences and the user's ETF data to generate grounded and personalized answers to user questions."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"ff400692","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.005524,"end_time":"2025-08-16T20:29:41.63028","exception":false,"start_time":"2025-08-16T20:29:41.624756","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["##
